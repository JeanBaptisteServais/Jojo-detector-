# work-on-picture

Hey my name's JB, I tested to make programs based on image processing. Because I think it's really cool and funny ! i tried to make a programm who by the presentation of a complex scene and the learning of detection of a plate would seek several objects at random and automatically detect other objects without learning of course, learning failed. 

but I had a lot of fun, most of the time! to work on the image for have the best dataset ever ! possible.


here are some applications:








<h1>Delete background</h1>

Here we try to recup the object in a background different from a white background 


<h1>repair multiple object</h1>

Here we recover and separate objects from each other in a scene like:


<h1>positioning</h1>

here we rotate the image to put the object in a desired direction with soh cah toa
