                                                                                                                                                                       
<strong><h1>STEP TWO</h1></strong>

So, we course the picture to search eventually an object from our database. <em>Here we have learn a plate.</em> and try to detect it.

But how can we repear us in the case where we have 50 models composed by each 9 labels ?<br>
So we make a label file who say to us <strong>the name of the model, the name of the object, the label of this object, the name of his part and his dimension</strong>
<br> 

For example : spoon spoon 1 handle,tank 50x50

Now we can detect objects in memory like that :

</p>


Finally we can recup the detection and try to make a reconciliation of object liaison from a situation. We serve to a plate in one situation for eat, so we search all others objects who can be use in the situation.
