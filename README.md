Hey my name's JB, I tested to make programs based on image processing. Because I think it's really cool and funny ! and to improve my skill in deep learning for my project synergo <br><br>
The goal of this project is to learn to detect object without external help (from a human) objects from a picture. 
 
For that, we learned to detecte plate. And hope it detect others objects.
 
I had a lot of fun, most of the time! to work on the image for have the best dataset ever ! possible (<em>it doesn't work, blam the dataset</em>)


This program is intelligent because it learns by itself and writes itself (to make eye-catching) or this program downloads images on the internet and makes comparaisons..
