<h1>Presentation</h1>
<br>
Hey my name's JB, i 25 years old, French, i a young Web developer i just graduate from 2 month. I coding from a little more than one year. Indeed i'm issue from Litterature and Sciences cognitives. <br>

I tested to make programs based on image processing.<br> Because I think it's really cool and funny. I love picture and the pixel's problems aspects ! I just discover IA, so i try to make program with IA (who's a wow tool) couple with image processing. (You can tcheck my captchat resolver or my plate detector with a slider !!!!)

<h3>Resum of the project</h3>

We want this project to learn by itself to learn to recognize objects without external help. Like a personn goes search on internet informations when she doesn't know something.

<h3>what is this project doing</h3>

In some, we <strong>learn initially</strong> our program some objects and present to it a picture. <em>Here we learn to it a plate and present to it a picture with a plate, two spoons, a fork and a knife.</em>
<br>
It will cut all objects and rewrite it in a new picture. For each pictures we'll <strong>try to detect our objects from our models. </strong><em>Here we try to detect the plate and rewrite all others objects into new picture.</em><br>
After detection of our objects it'll <strong>search category of our detection</strong>, <em>Here it'll search plate on internet and search all other items from the category (washing up) of plate and return items</em>. We <strong>download all of this items and train it.</strong> and remake a detection.

<h1>Problematic</h1>

We know importance of dataset. Imagine a cloud just for IA programs. We know the new dream to archieve an strong IA. The dream to learn itself and solving itself new problem and to writte itself program.
<br><br>

<strong>Our answer:</strong> 

<details>We tried with low result. But it didn't answer to the problematic it just for catching eyes ^^

<br><br>

<h2>This is what we do in real.</h2>
<h3>We try to detect unknow objects from plate by learning from google image.</h3>

<strong><h1>STEP ONE</h1></strong>

This first step is for entrance our picture. From this entrance we try to treat picture. Care it only work with our picture. why? because it's so exausting...
<br>
So we treat the picture, we clean the background (if the background isn't white). From that we trying to take contours (except the smaller contour who's represent noise, pixels that we do not want), so we try to take objects in the picture. And to copy them in a new white picture. We have a white in most of the cases, background !

<strong><h1>STEP TWO</h1></strong>

Sometimes we have many objects on our
