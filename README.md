# work-on-picture (in testing)

Hey my name's JB, I tested to make programs based on image processing. Because I think it's really cool and funny ! i tried to make a programm who by the presentation of a complex scene and the learning of detection of a plate would seek several objects at random and automatically detect other objects without explicite objects learning. It based on scrap and download picture on the web. 

but I had a lot of fun, most of the time! to work on the image for have the best dataset ever ! possible (<em>it doesn't work, blam the dataset</em>).


here are some applications:





<h1>scrap</h1>


<h1>Image processing</h1>


<h4>Delete background</h4>
Here we try to recup the object in a background different from a white background 


<h4>repair multiple object</h4>

Here we recover and separate objects from each other in a scene like:


<h4>positioning</h4>

here we rotate the image to put the object in a desired direction with soh cah toa
