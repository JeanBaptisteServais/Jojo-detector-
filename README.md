<h1>Presentation</h1>
<br>
Hey my name's JB, i 25 years old, French, i a young Web developer i just graduate from 2 month. I coding from a little more than one year. Indeed i'm issue from Litterature and Sciences cognitives. <br>

I tested to make programs based on image processing.<br> Because I think it's really cool and funny. I love picture and the pixel's problems aspects ! I just discover IA, so i try to make program with IA (who's a wow tool) couple with image processing. (You can tcheck my captchat resolver or my plate detector with a slider !!!!)

<h3>Resum of the project</h3>

We want this project to learn by itself to learn to recognize objects without external help. Like a personn goes search on internet informations when she doesn't know something.

<h3>what is this project doing</h3>

In some, we <strong>learn initially</strong> our program some objects and present to it a picture. <em>Here we learn to it a plate and present to it a picture with a plate, two spoons, a fork and a knife.</em>
<br>
It will cut all objects and rewrite it in a new picture. For each pictures we'll <strong>try to detect our objects from our models. </strong><em>Here we try to detect the plate and rewrite all others objects into new picture.</em><br>
After detection of our objects it'll <strong>search category of our detection</strong>, <em>Here it'll search plate on internet and search all other items from the category (washing up) of plate and return items</em>. We <strong>download all of this items and train it.</strong> and remake a detection.

<br><br>


<h1>Problematic</h1>

We know importance of dataset. Imagine a cloud just for IA programs. We know the new dream to archieve an strong IA. The dream to learn itself and solving itself new problem and to writte itself program.
<br><br>

spoiler: <details>We tried with low result. But it didn't answer to the problematic it just for catching eyes ^^</details>
